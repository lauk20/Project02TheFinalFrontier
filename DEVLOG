1/12/22 10:41 PM: Completed the very basic code the establish a connection between a Server and Client. Also worked on the Server's portion of code to handle the forking servers (sub-servers) using Pipes. Need to improve it so that the sub-server can read from both the client socket and the server pipe.
1/13/22 11:43 AM: Completed establishing connection and reading from multiple pipes using select on Main Server. Started select functionality on Sub-Server.
1/14/22 ~11:45 AM: Fixed bug where the file descriptors were incorrectly used (used read pipe instead of write pipe).
1/14/22 10:17 PM: Rewrote server.c in a way that uses select properly instead of keeping an array of file/pipe/socket descriptors. Next need to make client handle the message that sub-server sends.
1/15/22 02:30 PM: Client can now receive messages from the Sub-Server. It also uses a pipe to send data to the Client Display, where messages are shown to the client.
1/15/22 04:05 PM: Rewrote in a way that reads and write struct message_struct that has the "name" and "message" fields. Uses that struct instead of just a string now.
1/18/22 ~11:45 AM: Tested the program using the CS-LAB machines and found a bug where the Server would close itself when a Client disconnects and then reconnects. Tried to find the cause.
1/18/22 09:04 PM: Found the cause of the bug and tried fixing it. Eventually found a simple solution that fixed it (added a new variable to the message struct to indicate commands from the Sub-Server to the Server, maybe even expandable to Client sent commands?).
1/19/22 11:37 AM: Changed/added the/a disconnect message when a client disconnects. Made so that the client can now connect to a specific address using "./client [address here]".
1/20/22 ~11:45 AM: Fixed bug where the client display would go into an infinite lop if it was run before the client. Worked on getting the client process to end when the client_display process ends.
1/20/22: 09:43 PM: Continued to work on getting the client program to end when the client display process ends.
1/21/22: ~11:45 AM: Found another way to break the Server by disconnecting the Client twice. Fixed the bug as far as testing goes.
1/21/22: 09:08 PM: Added the "/kick [user]" command. The command can be used in the chat by to kick anyone from the chat by using their username (example: "/kick user"). Currently must be typed exactly in the format "/kick user". It can also be used by anyone currently.
1/22/22: 01:15 PM: Adjusted the networking.c functions to allow for the Server to know the address of the connecting Client.
1/22/22: 01:53 PM: Added feature where only Clients that are on the same machine as the Server can have special permissions to kick other users using the "/kick user" command.
1/22/22: 05:30 PM: Added mute command. Clients can be muted, can read chats but cannot send chats. "/mute user".
1/22/22: 06:04 PM: Clients that use spaces in their names will now have the spaces replaced with dashes (-) in order to make them compatible with the kick and mute commands.
